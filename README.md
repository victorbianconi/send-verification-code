# send-verification-code
A structure I used to send verification codes after sign-up, via Nodemailer in NextJS. 

This repository is just to show the general logic and not intended to be cloned and used.

# 1. signUp
this is the endpoint called during sign up from the client. 

# 2. submitVerificationCode
after sign up, the client is invited to check their inbox to enter the verification code.
